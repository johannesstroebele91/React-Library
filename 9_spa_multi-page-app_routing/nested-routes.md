# Nesting routes

Enables to handle not just pages side by side

- but also pages inside of a route
- by defining Route inside a Route

# Example

In the App.js could be a Route

- and also in one of the routes could be one
- e.g. in the Welcome.js component

For this to happen

- start of the path of the sub-route
- needs to be the same as the route that is higher up
- e.g. "/welcome/new-user"
