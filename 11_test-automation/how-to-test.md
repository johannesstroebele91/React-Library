# Basics

Tool for running tests and asserting the results, most popular for React is Jest
For "simulating" (rendering) the React app / components the React Testing Library is used

# Jest

Normally Jest tests can be run

- by executing the cmd `npm test`

# 3 AAAs

1. Arrange: set up the test data, test conditions, and test environment
2. Act: run logic that should be executed (e.g. execute function)
3. Assert: compare executed results with expected results

# IMPORTANT ERROR TESTING

Always now how to break the test

- and check if the test fails
- if the test is broken
