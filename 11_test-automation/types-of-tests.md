# 1. Manual testing

- developer writes code
- look at the preview of the application and test by clicking through newly build functionalities
- PROBLEM: is error-prone due to difficulty to test all possible scenarios and ripple effects

# 2. Automated testing

- code that tests your code
- by individually testing the building blocks of the app
- by testing error cases, and rare results
- PROBLEM: time-consuming and technically demandind

## 2.1 Unit Tests

- for the individual buildings blocks (functions, components) of the app
- so tests blocks completely isolated
- Quantity: Are the majority of the tests in the app

## 2.2 Integration Tests

- for the combination of multiple building blocks
- Quantity: Are medium number of tests in the app

## 2.3 End-to-End (e2e) Tests

- for testing complete scenarios of the app
- as the user would experience them
- so can be only done manually
- Quantity: Are only a few mostly in the app
