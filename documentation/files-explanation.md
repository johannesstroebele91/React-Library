# Basics
- `public`: building folder
  - `public/index.html`:
    - is the single HTML file which is loaded in the browser
    - so it is the single page of the SPA
    - It includes the 'root' element,
    - which ReactDOM uses to render something in this place 
- `src`: actual source files
  - `index.js/ts`: is the entry file of the project `src/index.js` or `src/index.ts` which references the `public/index.html`
  - `App.js`: manages all of the React component
  - and is injected into the element  `<App />` 
- `package.json`
  - holes all the dependencies of the project
  - e.g. react, react-dom, ...
  - scripts
