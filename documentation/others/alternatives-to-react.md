# Alternatives

1. React: lean and focused component-based UI library

- for SPA, additional dependencies need to be added
- need to rely on the community a lot

2. Angular: complete component-based UI framework with build-in TS

- ships more build-in features
- can be an overkill for smaller projects
- donâ€™t need to rely on the community as much

3. Vue.js: mixture of Angular and React

- Complete component-based UI framework
- Bit less features like Angular, but more than React
