# 1) Basics

- React is a Client side JS library
- It combines HTML, CSS and JS to build the UI
- Goal is to build UIs for the web
- by creating re-usable and reactive components

# 2) Application Areas

- Widget: React can control parts of a normal HTML website
- SPA: React can enable to build Single-Page-Apps from the ground up
  - React helps to control the entire frontend
  - Also for switching pages
  - So only 1 HTML file is requested (therefore SPA)
  - React takes over the rest

# 3) Declarative approach

- Is used for building component
- by defining the desired target state(s) and
- letting React figure out the actual JS DOM instructions
- so, it splits the app into components, each with a specific task
- This is in contrast to the imperative approach of Vanilla JS
  - where lot of code needed to be written multiple times and
  - updated if changes occur
