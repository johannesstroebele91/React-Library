# Basics
- `public`: building folder
  - `public/index.html`:
    - is the single HTML file which is loaded in the browser
    - so it is the single page of the SPA
    - It includes the 'root' element,
    - which ReactDOM uses to render something in this place 
- `src`: actual source files
  - `index.js/ts`: is the entry file of the project `src/index.js` or `src/index.js/tsx`
    - imports the whole React app
    - by importing it from the `App.tsx` 
    - Further, it forwards all code to the `public/index.html`
- `App.js/tsx`: root component
  - which manages all of the React component
  - by referencing all other React components 
  - and exporting its content using `export default App;`
- `package.json`
  - holes all the dependencies of the project
  - e.g. react, react-dom, ...
  - scripts
