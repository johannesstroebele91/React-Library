## 1.1) Create React App

https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html
```npx create-react-app my-app```

**It sets up your development environment**

- so that you can use the latest JavaScript features,
- provides a nice developer experience,
- and optimizes your app for production

**It creates a frontend build pipeline,**
- so you can use it with any backend you want

**Instructions**
- ```npm run``` or ```npm run build```
- Will start the development server
  - When youâ€™re ready to deploy to production,
  - running this cmd will create an optimized build of your app
  - in the build folder
- ```npm start```

**Under the hood, it uses:**
- Babel
- Webpack

## 1.2) [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/):
  - Is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert
  - ECMAScript 2015+ code
  - into a backwards compatible version of JS
  - in current and older browsers or environments
## 1.3) [Webpack](webpack.md)
  - unify all these different sources and module types
  - in a way that's possible to import everything in your JS code,
  - and finally produce a shippable output


## 1.4) Node.js
* Runtime environment for JS
* Run JS outside of the browser

**Why is this need although React Code solely runs in the browser?**
* Only the final production code will run in the browser
  * Node.js is used for two reasons
    * Creating the React App ```create-react-app``` 
    * And for the development server (preview), which is responsible for the behind the scenes optimization steps
