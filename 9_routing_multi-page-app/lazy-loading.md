# Basics

Problem is that the visitor of a page

- can normally only use the page
- if all of the content is downloaded
- there the visitor has to wait

# Opportunity to minify the code

Lazy loading enables to

- only downloaded
- if the visitor actually visits the specific page

This is done by

- splitting the code
- into multiple bundles
- which are only downloaded
- when there are needed

This can be implemented

- via the routing
- thereby splitting the application
- by the route of the visitor

# Example

```javascript
import React, { Suspense } from "react";
import { Redirect, Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom";
import Layout from "./components/layout/Layout";
import LoadingSpinner from "./components/UI/LoadingSpinner";

const NewQuote = React.lazy(() => import("./pages/NewQuote"));
const QuoteDetail = React.lazy(() => import("./pages/QuoteDetail"));
const NotFound = React.lazy(() => import("./pages/NotFound"));
const AllQuotes = React.lazy(() => import("./pages/AllQuotes"));

function App() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <Suspense
        fallback={
          <div className="centered">
            <LoadingSpinner />
          </div>
        }
      >
        <Switch>
          <Route path="/" exact>
            <Redirect to="/quotes" />
          </Route>
          <Route path="/quotes" exact>
            <AllQuotes />
          </Route>
          <Route path="/quotes/:quoteId">
            <QuoteDetail />
          </Route>
          <Route path="/new-quote">
            <NewQuote />
          </Route>
          <Route path="/new-quote">
            <NewQuote />
          </Route>
          <Route path="*">
            <NotFound />
          </Route>
        </Switch>
      </Suspense>
    </Layout>
  );
}
```
